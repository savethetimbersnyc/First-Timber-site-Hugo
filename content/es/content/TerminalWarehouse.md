Built in 1891. The timbers used to build it were extracted from an old-growth Longleaf Pine forest from a nearby region of US. Although at the time of the construction the provenance of the timbers was probably known for many, at present the specific region where the wood was extracted it is not known to us.
As part of our mision, we rescued some of these timbers to find out where they are from. 
A team of scientist at Columbia University Edward Cook, Caroline Leland, Mukund P. Rao and Benjamin Cook collected these timbers and are working in a scientific article to describe the provenance of these timbers.
