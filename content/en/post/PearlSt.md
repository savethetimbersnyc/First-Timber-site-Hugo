Lower Manhattan is one of Manhattan's oldest neighborhoods. 211 Pearl St. was built in 1831 by William Colgate, the founder of the Colgate-Palmolive Company company. The construction of the building relied extensively on eastern white pine timbers (Pinus strobus). Using dendrochronology we were able to provenance these timbers to have been sourced from the Adirondack region of upstate New York, likely by a sawmill located at Glenn Falls. The outermost ring of the timbers date to 1789 suggesting that the timbers were likely cut a few decades in advance of the construction of this building.
