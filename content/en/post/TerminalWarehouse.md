Built in 1891. The timbers used to build it were extracted from an old-growth Longleaf Pine forest from a nearby region of US. As part of our mission, we rescued some of these timbers to find out where they are from. A team of scientist at Columbia University Edward Cook, Caroline Leland, Mukund P. Rao and Benjamin Cook collected these timbers and are working in a scientific article to describe the provenance of these timbers.
