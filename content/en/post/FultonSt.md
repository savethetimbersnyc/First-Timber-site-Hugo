Built at the beginning of the 20th century (likely around 1907), this building withhold precious stories. The timbers used to build it were extracted from an old-growth Longleaf Pine forest from a nearby region of US. Although at the time of the construction the provenance of the timbers was probably known for many, at present the specific region where the wood was extracted it is not known to us.
As part of our mision, we rescued some of these timbers to find out where they are from. 
As you can see from the picture the trees were several years old. Look how many the tree-rings the have!
