_Save the timbers NYC_ is a non-profit organization run by scientists, the Sawkill Lumber company and individuals.
The city of New York was largely built using timbers extracted from United States old-growth forest.
Depending on the technology and accesibility at the time of construction, the provenance of these timbers has changed through time.
Trees have an amazing feature: they record their stories in their tree-rings!
Our main objective is to collect timbers from buildings that are being demolished and find out the stories hiden in the wood constituting their joists, columns, floors and even furniture!
Unfortunately, many buildings are being demolished in the city and most of the construction wood is not preserved. As part of our mision, we rescued some of these timbers to find out where they are from.
