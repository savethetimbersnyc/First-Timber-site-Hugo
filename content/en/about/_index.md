## About us

**_Save the timbers NYC_** is a non-profit organization working with contractors, real-estate developers, NYC agencies, and owners to study, repurpose and rehabilitate timbers from historical buildings in the Greater NYC area. Reclaimed woods are a versatile material, increasingly popular for interior design, furniture, and crafted objects. They are a limited resource with unique qualities of beauty, history, and contributions to sustainability. The broad spectrum of active demolition/renovation projects in NYC provides a foundation of scientific research and rehabilitation of old-growth woods. However, there is no citywide requirement for preservation of these timbers.
 
## Our mission
Our mission is to salvage and preserve a relic of the old growth forests for dendrochronological research (i.e., tree-ring science), public awareness, and rehabilitation.
After repurposed, the timbers are distinguished in their detailed provenance and dating, design partnerships, and social outreach mission, transforming a salvaged material which could have otherwise been sent to a landfill into a value-added product with heirloom potential.

## Our history
_Save the timbers NYC_ was founded by Mukund Palat Rao, Milagros Rodriguez-Caton, Caroline Leland, and Columbia University’s Tree Ring Laboratory (CU-TRL) in partnership with Alan Solomon the co-founder of Sawkill Lumber LLC. Our scientific advisors are Dr Edward Cook and Dr Rosanne D'Arrigo.
In just one month since its founding in January 2021, we have salvaged and dendrochronologically provenanced timbers from three historic buildings built in 1832, 1890, and 1909, that are being demolished or renovated.

# Scientific Advisors
## Edward Cook
Dr Edward Cook is co-founder of CU-TRL and is an expert in quantitative studies of tree rings. His continental scale drought atlases have been fundamental to our current understanding of earth’s hydroclimate over the Common Era. He has many years of experience in the tree-ring dating of historical structures in the greater New York area.

## Rosanne D'Arrigo
Dr Rosanne D'Arrigo is an accomplished scientist known for her insightful, rigorous, and original contributions to the development of high-resolution paleoclimatology. She produced some of the first paleoclimate records validating widespread climate change and global warming.
